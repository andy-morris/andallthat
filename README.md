# Sample code from _Term Rewriting and All That_ by Tobias Nipkow

```
$ poly
> use "all.ML";
> (* ... *)
```

All this is so far is a file `all.ML` which loads everything.

Todo (maybe):

- [ ] Replace uses of `library.ML` with Basis lib
- [ ] Move things into structures
- [ ] Add SML/NJ & MLton package files

All the code of actual substance is copyright 1998 Cambridge University Press.
